    <p>
        Ahmedabad, the largest city in Gujarat, is a vibrant blend of rich history, culture, and modern development.
        Founded
        in 1411 by Sultan Ahmad Shah, it is known for its stunning architecture, from the intricate carvings of the Jama
        Masjid and the stepwells to the modern marvels like the Sabarmati Riverfront.

        The city holds special importance in Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle as Mahatma Gandhi established the Sabarmati Ashram here. Ahmedabad is also famous for its textile industry, often called the "Manchester of India," and for its delicious street food, colorful festivals like Uttarayan (kite festival), and Navratri garba nights.

        In 2017, it became the first Indian city to be declared a UNESCO World Heritage City, showcasing its perfect mix of tradition and progress.
