    <h1>The history of Computers and internet</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as the abacus. Later, Charles Babbage
        proposed the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, considered the <strong>first concept of a programmable
            computer</strong>.They were not like the sleek laptops we use today—instead, they took up entire rooms, used
        vacuum tubes for processing, and consumed huge amounts of electricity. Famous examples include the <i>ENIAC</i>
        and <i>UNIVAC</i>. These machines were very slow compared to modern standards and had limited memory, but they
        laid the foundation for today’s technology. Over time, vacuum tubes were replaced by transistors and microchips,
        making computers smaller, faster, and more reliable, eventually leading to the personal computers we use every
        day.

    <h2>Genrations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> has evolved from vacuum tubes to modern microprocessors.
        The 1st generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, while the 2nd generation relied on <i>transistors</i>. By the
        4th generation, computers became <em>personal and affordable</em>. Computers are classified into five
        generations based on <em> technology</em> and <em>development</em>. The first generation (1940–1956) used vacuum
        tubes and were large, slow, and costly. The second generation (1956–1963) replaced vacuum tubes with
        transistors, making computers faster and smaller. The third generation (1964–1971) used integrated circuits
        (ICs), which improved speed, efficiency, and reduced size. The fourth generation (1971–present) introduced
        microprocessors, leading to personal computers. The fifth generation (present and future) focuses on artificial
        intelligence, machine learning, and advanced technologies to make computers more intelligent and capable.

    <h2>Mathematics in Computing</h2>
    <p>
        A famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup>

    <p>
        Another example: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water.

    <p>
        Another example: 2KE = mv<sup>2</sup>

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by Tim Berners-Lee. As he once said:
    <blockquote>
        "The power of the Web is in its universality.Access by regardless of disability is an essential aspect." –
        <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Internet was born from a project called ARPANET in 1969, which was created by the U.S. Department of Defense
        to connect computers and ensure communication even during emergencies. In the 1970s, important technologies like
        email and the TCP/IP protocols were developed, allowing computers to communicate in a standard way. By 1983,
        TCP/IP became the official networking standard, marking the true birth of the modern Internet. In 1991, Tim
        Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web (WWW), which made the Internet accessible to the public through
        websites and browsers. From then on, the Internet rapidly expanded, becoming an essential part of daily life
        with the rise of broadband, Wi-Fi, smartphones, and social media.

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        Today, we use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins> and fiber connections. Computers now fit in our
        <small>pockets as smartphones</small>.The Modern Era generally refers to the period from the late 15th century
        (around 1500 CE) to the present day. It began after the Middle Ages with events like the Renaissance, Age of
        Exploration, and the invention of the printing press. This era saw huge changes in science, politics, and
        society — including the Industrial Revolution, rise of democracy, and major world events like the World Wars. In
        the late 20th century, the Information Age started with computers, the Internet, and globalization, shaping the
        world we live in today

    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <p>
        To display text on a webpage, you can use:

    <pre>
        <code>
&lt;html&gt; 
&lt;body&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt; Hello World&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt; 
        </code>
    </pre>
    Another example: Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text. <br>
    System response: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>
    </p>
