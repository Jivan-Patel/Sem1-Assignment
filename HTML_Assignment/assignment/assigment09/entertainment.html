        Conservative activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk was shot during an event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Shortly afterward, the name Michael Mallinson began circulating online as the alleged shooter. The claim originated from an X (formerly Twitter) account ‘Fox 11 Reno’, which posted: “Charlie Kirk shooter confirmed to be Michael Mallinson, a registered Democrat in the state of Utah,” alongside a photo of an elderly man.

        However, the account quickly retracted the statement, issuing a correction: “CORRECTION: This man is actually Kevin Spitz of Washington, D.C.” As of now, neither name—Michael Mallinson nor Kevin Spitz—has been confirmed by authorities. Hindustan Times has not been able to independently verify the identity of the suspected shooter, and the situation remains under investigation.

    </p>
        Warner Bros.’ “The Conjuring: Last Rites” scared up a commanding No. 1 debut at the U.K. and Ireland box office, grossing £6.8 million ($9.1 million), according to Comscore. The latest entry in the supernatural horror franchise opened well ahead of all competition and is poised to drive strong late-summer business.

        Multiplex chain Vue Cinema founder and CEO Tim Richards said: “The remarkable success of ‘The Conjuring: Last Rites’ last weekend, grossing $187 million globally and delivering the third largest horror opening ever in the UK and Ireland with £6.8 million, is the latest sign of the horror genre’s phenomenal hold on audiences this year, joining hits like ‘Weapons,’ ‘Final Destination: Bloodlines’ and ‘Sinners.’ When a film delivers both scares and a great story, audiences turn out in huge numbers because there is simply no substitute for the thrill of horror on the big screen. Sharing every shock and scream together with family or friends is what makes cinemagoing so exciting and appealing, especially, as we’re seeing, for younger audiences.”
