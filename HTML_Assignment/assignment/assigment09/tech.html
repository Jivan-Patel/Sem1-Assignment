    <h3>YouTube expands multi-language audio dubbing to all creators</h3>
    <p>
        YouTube says its multi-language audio dubbing feature has helped popular creators like MrBeast and Mark Rober to reach millions of new viewers.

        YouTube has announced it will be expanding the multi-language audio dubbing feature for all creators over the next few weeks. This will enable all creators around the world to reach a wider audience and viewers to watch videos in their native language.
    </p>
    <p>
        Introduced back in 2023 as a pilot program, the feature was initially limited to select YouTubers. But now, it will be rolling out for everyone, be it big or small creators. In a blog post, YouTube says that on average, creators who uploaded multi-language audio tracks for their videos saw their watch time increase by over 25 per cent from viewers who did not speak the language in which the video was not originally recorded.

        “Now, when a YouTube creator in the US releases a new video, within moments a viewer in Korea, Brazil, and India can watch it in their native language”, the platform said.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, Jamie Oliver, a chef who runs a YouTube channel, saw his viewership increase three times after using multi-language audio tracks. The platform said that some of the most well-known creators like MrBeast and Mark Rober have gained millions of viewers from all around the world, with Rober having the highest number of multi-language audio dubs uploaded, averaging over 30 languages per video.
