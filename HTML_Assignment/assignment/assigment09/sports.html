    <h3>Suryakumar withdraws appeal against Siddique to spark debate</h3>
    <p>
        "Why go down that route," Aakash Chopra asks on ESPNcricinfo's T20 Time Out show
    </p>
    <p>
        Suryakumar Yadav, the India captain, withdrew an appeal against Junaid Siddique on Wednesday night in Dubai despite the batter being given out by the third umpire.
    </p>
    <p>
        The incident took place in the 13th over of the UAE innings. Siddique was beaten while attempting a pull off Shivam Dube, and was found outside the crease when wicketkeeper Sanju Samson collected the ball and under-armed a direct hit to the stumps at the striker's end. As soon as he missed the ball, Siddique seemed to point towards the towel that Dube appeared to have dropped while delivering the ball.

        Neeraj Chopra and Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem will battle for javelin gold in Tokyo next week, the latest chapter in a brotherly rivalry which has soured since a deadly military conflict between their countries.

    <p>
        Ever since his breakthrough Olympic triumph in 2021, javelin fans have been wondering when Neeraj Chopra would breach the 90-metre line. The Indian superstar finally achieved that landmark earlier this year with his 90.23m national record at the Diamond League meeting in Doha.
